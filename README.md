# Peter Beverloo

## peter.sh
This was once the personal weblog of Peter Beverloo, but that hasn't really been the case for about a decade. Today, its main feature is the Chromium command line flag overview, which is periodically generated from Chromium's source code.

The site is a largely static environment built with Next.js, deployed using a Docker container. There is no particular reason for this technology choice other than habitsâ€”I have other successful Next.js and React-based projects and enjoy working in that stack, despite being well aware of the costs.

## tests.peter.sh
This site hosts a variety of test cases focused on the Web Notification and Web Push APIs. They're widely referenced by other websites and still attract thousands of visitors every day. Source code can be found in the [/public/tests/](/public/tests/) directory.
